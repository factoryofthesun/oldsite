I am a post-graduate research assistant in the [3DL lab](https://threedle.cs.uchicago.edu/) at UChicago with [Professor Rana Hanocka](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~ranahanocka/). My interests lie at the intersection of differential geometry, 3D deep learning, and computer graphics. I received my B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in Economics from UChicago in 2019.

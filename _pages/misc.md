### TFT Reroll Calculator
Launched in 3/2020

I model each round in the autochess game Teamfight Tactics as states in an absorbing Markov chain. I use this to develop a general-purpose calculator for computing the probability distribution of observing any game state given user-specific conditions.

### POTUSSentiBot: A Twitter sentiment classification bot 
Active period: 1/10/20 - 8/3/20

Using the model described in [Sun, Huang, and Qiu 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09588), I scrape daily tweets that mention the two primary candidates in the 2020 US Presidential Elections, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, and predict the Twitter community's sentiment towards them.
